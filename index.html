    <h2>Welcome to my Web115 page!</h2>
    <p>I am a twenty year old programmer from Charlotte, NC. I do not have a professional background in programming yet, however, I plan on changing that in the near future.</p>      
    <p>
      Here, you can navigate to my <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a>, <a href="contract.html">Contract</a>, and <a href="brand.html">Brand</a> pages. To learn more about me, feel free to navigate over to my Introduction page. <br>
      Over time, this page will be updated and look way less boring, but I appreciate anyone who is visiting. <br>
      Good luck to you all, and I hope everyone has a great semester. Thank you for visiting my GitHub!
