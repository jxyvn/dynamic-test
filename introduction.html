      <p><strong>Personal background:</strong> I am a twenty-year-old from Charlotte. I enjoy music, skateboarding, and being outside with nature.</p>

      <p><strong>Background in this subject:</strong> I have no background history with programming outside of coursework projects from other classes and personal projects for experience.</p>
      <p><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Desktop PC with Windows 11.</p>
      <p><strong>Courses Iâ€™m Taking and Why:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Web115 - Web Markup and Scripting:</strong> I am taking this course to further advance my knowledge and experience with front-end programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Web140 - Web Development Tools:</strong> I am taking this course to improve on building websites altogether.</li>
        <li><strong>DBA120 - Database Programming I:</strong> I am taking this course to learn about databases and get familiar with SQL programming.</li>

      <p><strong>Funny/Interesting item about myself:</strong> I went to Mumbai, India, in late 2023 for my sister's wedding since my brother-in-law is from there, and most of his family currently still lives there. It was a great experience, and seeing the differences between an American and Indian wedding was unbelievable.</p>
